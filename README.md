**Doors open at 5:00, talks begin at 5:30ish!**

The pandemic kept many of us inside, writing copious amounts of new code for our hobbies & jobs. In the spirit of Open Source we welcome you, Chicagoland R users, to attend and consider contributing a short talk on the novel work you're proud of. As always, slides including simple code that can be displayed in a readable way is encouraged. [Register here](https://forms.gle/oE7pXjkUzKyXuvQH9) to present and/or just Bring Your Own Slide Deck!
